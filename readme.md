**go.mod file** tells Go which packages the project will use. its like a package.json file. it lists dependencies and their version
**go.sum file** is automatically generated whenever you add go packages using go get. It provides security guarantees that the dependencies havenâ€™t been modified
**go mod tidy** If you ever want to clean up unused deps

**LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GUIDE**

# Entities

User -> id, name, email, password, role (admin or normal user)
Books -> id, title, author, stock
Borrows -> id, user_id (who borrowed -> fk to users), book_id (which book was borrowed -> fk to books), borrow_date, return_date (can be null if not yet returned)

# Admin

- manages books, monitors users, and updates stock

# Normal user

- Registers, logs in, borrows and returns books.

# High level flow

- Users sign up and log in -> uses JWT token for auth
- Admin can add, update, delete books.
- User can borrow available books, if stock is > 0.
- when borrowing, stock decreases by 1 vice versa when you return a book.
- System keeps history of who borrowed what and when.

**Relationships Btn Entities**

1. User to Borrow

# 1 to Many

- one user can borrow many books over time.
- Each borrow record belongs to only one user.

2. Book to Borrow

# 1 to many

- One book can appear in many borrow records (different users borrowing at different times)
- Each borrow record belongs to one book.

3. User to Book (many to many) (indirectly via borrow)

- user can borrow many books
- A book can be borrowed by many users.
- This r/shp will be modeled by borrows table.

**Difference Between log.default().Println() and fmt.Println()**

# fmt

- fmt belongs to the **fmt** package.
- it prints text to the console.
- has no timestamps, no logs, just raw text.
- example --> Connected to database

# log.default()

- Belongs to the log package
- log.Default returns the default logger instance in GO.
- it includes timestamps and supports logging with more structured info.
- example --> 2025/08/21 10:30:00 Connected to database
